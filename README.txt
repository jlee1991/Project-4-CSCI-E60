PROBLEM SET 4: README file

The below is a breakdown of the components of my Problem Set 4 for CSCI-E60. There are a few places that I would improve upon with more time, especially increased security. First, I could seek to include an additional application file to store my username and password. Additionally, I attempted to use the syntax to prevent SQL injection did not completely work with the code. 

PROJECT 1:
- Query and Triggers in: 2015ps4.sql (located in /public_html)
- Spool File: 2015ps4.lst (located in /public_html)

PROJECT 2:
Note: As per PS-3, there is always less than 2 price quotes per Part, so the conditional statement is always in effect.
- The assignment is all contained within searchandshowquotes.cfm (located in /public_html)

PROJECT 3:
- Storyboard PS4-3.pptx

PROJECT 4:
Note: There was difficulty passing the variables among three pages, so the single page would be the working file for the application, whereas feedback would be appreciated for the other pages

Created one large file called productandcomponent.cfm, which will
- Create a list of the products,
- Allow me to select the components
- Edit the components

Because the storyboard has the functionality divided into three elements/pages
- Products.cfm: User enters product number
- ShowComponent.cfm: User selects component
- EditComponent.cfm: User edits component

PROJECT 5: See Project 4

PROJECT 6: See index.cfm (located in /public_html)
